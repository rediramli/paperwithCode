With the advancement of deep learning, a growing body of research has emerged addressing problems in communication fields utilizing deep learning techniques. However, reproducible research remains challenging, as most communication-related papers do not provide open source code. In recent years, the number of communication papers leveraging deep learning has risen sharpely, and their authors have shown a greater inclination to share their code openly. To further advance DL-based resource management in mmWave NOMA, we present a collection of open-source DL frameworks, presented in Table 3, are tools designed to help researchers develop, prototype, and deploy DL models in production, supporting existing DL algorithms and
allowing for quick experimentation. To further facilitate the development of DL-based mmWave-NOMA, we provide a list of relevant data sets in Table 4. Additionally, Table 5 provides a summary of recent research on power allocation, energy management, and subcarrier allocation accompanied by their open source code. However, due to limitations, only open-source codes for these three areas were found, while others like user association and bandwidth allocation might
not have been covered. In science, sharing is the way to enable research reproducibility and swift improvements of the state-of-the-art. The availability of these resources including DL frameworks, datasets, and open source code, is anticipated to significantly accelerate research progress in the field of DL for mmWave NOMA

With the development of deep learning, more and more research has been done to solve problems in related communication fields using deep learning. As a graduate student in communications, if the lab does not have the code to accumulate in the relevant direction, it will be very difficult to get started and go deep into a new direction. At the same time, most papers in the field of communication do not provide open source code, and reproducible research is difficult.
The communication papers based on deep learning have increased rapidly in recent years, and the authors of these papers are more willing to open source. This project focuses on the collection of papers which are relevant to wireless communication based on deep learning and released the code .
The area of personal attention and limited efforts, this list will not be so complete. If you know some related open source papers, but not on this list, you are welcome to pull request.
