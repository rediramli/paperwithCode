With the rapid advancement of deep learning, an increasing amount of research has been dedicated to addressing challenges in communication systems through deep learning techniques. For a graduate student in communications, entering a new research direction can be particularly challenging without existing code or prior work within the lab to build upon. Unfortunately, many papers in the communication field do not offer open-source code, making it difficult to reproduce their results and slowing progress in the field. However, in recent years, there has been a surge in communication papers utilizing deep learning, and more researchers are now making their code publicly available.

This project aims to compile a collection of papers related to wireless communication that are based on deep learning and provide open-source code for reproducibility. Due to personal interests and limited resources, this list may not be exhaustive. If you are aware of any relevant papers that include open-source code and are not currently on the list, contributions via pull requests are welcome and encouraged.
