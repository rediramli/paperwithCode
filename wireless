With the development of deep learning, more and more research has been done to solve problems in related communication fields using deep learning. As a graduate student in communications, if the lab does not have the code to accumulate in the relevant direction, it will be very difficult to get started and go deep into a new direction. At the same time, most papers in the field of communication do not provide open source code, and reproducible research is difficult.
The communication papers based on deep learning have increased rapidly in recent years, and the authors of these papers are more willing to open source. This project focuses on the collection of papers which are relevant to wireless communication based on deep learning and released the code .
The area of personal attention and limited efforts, this list will not be so complete. If you know some related open source papers, but not on this list, you are welcome to pull request.
